## Known Limitations

### Phase 1 & 2 Limitations

1. **Import Analysis**
   - Dynamic imports (`importlib.import_module`) have limited detection
   - Conditional imports may not be fully traced
   - Wildcard imports (`from x import *`) show limited detail

2. **Concurrency Analysis**
   - Static analysis cannot catch all race conditions
   - Dynamic testing requires careful scenario design
   - Threading behavior may vary across platforms

3. **Architecture Analysis**
   - Semantic analysis requires descriptive method names
   - LCOM calculation assumes method-attribute relationships
   - Clustering quality depends on code structure

4. **Reporting**
   - Large projects may generate very large HTML files
   - Interactive features require JavaScript-enabled browser
   - Graph rendering limited by NetworkX capabilities

### Future Improvements (Phase 3 & 4)

These limitations will be addressed in future phases:
- More sophisticated dynamic import handling
- ML-based anomaly detection
- Enhanced graph rendering with WebGL
- Incremental analysis for large projects
